        <h1>The Escape of Happiness</h1>
        <p> For my Interactive Media Design major, my group were tasked with creating a game based on the themes,
          survival and absurdism. We chose to create a horror turn-based game about a person trying to escape the
          wreckage of a space station, having to manage one's health and a resource called "happiness"</p>

        <h2>As a Game</h2>
        <p>The aformentioned "Happiness" functions very similiary to a mana/magic bar, using it for spells and attacks.
          The twist is, as you deplete your happiness meter, you're hit with various negative effects ranging from
          lowering your attack power to halving your HP.</p>

        <h2>The work I did</h2>
        <p>Our particular group found ourselves in a predicament, as we had less members than the other groups, and with my other group members not familiar with video games, it proved to be a little challenging.  So I did most of the brainstorming and helped explain the game mechanics we were going for. On top of this, I drew concept art as well as game assets for the game.   
        </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, we were unable to complete our game. With none of us had a good grasp on coding and being down a team member, we found ourselves struggling so we had to compromise and fall back on creating a mock-up instead.  Some day I do want to come back and finish it as it is an interesting game idea, but that's for another time.
