       <h2>ABOUT ME!</h2>

      <p> My name is Bryan Yee and I'm a sophomore at the University of Washington, Bothell campus. I'm a multimedia artist that has learned multiple coding languages, taught myself how to draw, 3D model and laser-cut wood. I have a fascination with storytelling and how one can convey stories through various mediums such as with audio, visuals, user input and interactive mediums that use all three such as video games or tabletop RPGs such as Dungeons and Dragons.</p>

       <h2>ABOUT THE SITE</h2>
      <p>This website is entire hand-coded and originated from my (CLASS) in which we created our own websites for a variety of purposes.  While the theme and aesthetic of the website has stayed fairly consistent, I've gone through quite a few iterations, to make the website it is today.  With a trial and error process of checking how something looked, changing it, checking it again, etc.  despite having to go through such a  mythical and tedious procedure, it allowed me to learn how each line reached to each other.  I got a few tips from peers that I've tried my best to implement with my basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Despite my limited knowledge of HTML and CSS, I'm fairly satified my little website as it is one I did myself. :D </p>
