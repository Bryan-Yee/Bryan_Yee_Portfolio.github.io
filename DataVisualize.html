        In my BIS232 course called : "Intro to Data Visualization" I was taught to use Rstudio, a programing language that is used to create graphs and data visualizations.  At first I really strugged with it due its strange lay out, interesting rules, such as being one of the only programming languages I know to start with 1 instead at 0, as well as coding with the console at the bottom.

        It took a while really understanding what I was able to accomplish with R, but after reading and getting help from my professor, I was able to figure it out.  R became a lot easier as soon as we moved onto the open window (FIND BETTE PHRASE FOR THIS) which is usually used for programming.

       In the class we worked in teams, while I've been heads of a team before, I'm always hesitant to take the leadership role.  But as usual there was not really anyone willing to fill that role so I had to fill it in. Due to our busy schedules we almost always ended up only working on the project on the last days it was due, but we always giving ourselves enough time so that we were never to the brink of not turning in the assignment.  Being the leader, I made sure no person was doing too much work, or too little, as well as splitting the groups up.  As I wasn't (at first) confident enough with R to help code, I took a more writing role with another group member while the other half worked on coding, and we would check on each other's work afterwards.  After I began to be more confident with R I began to juggle both sides, helping with coding problems when they happened as well as help writing and proof reading the written report.   Showing a flexability to take on many different tasks, as well as proper planning and work allocation so that we were able to finish our projects with time to spare despite our handicap.
