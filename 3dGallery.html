This was a personal project of mine.  It was to create a place where I could showcase my art, but I also wanted it to be more interesting, something to differientiate it from other people's galleries, so I decided to create my own art gallery in 3D. 
 The idea came after I had gone to many different art museums over the summer, that I, if I learned to, could create my own art gallery that I could use to showcase my art.  So I got to work, slowly learning Autodesk Maya.  At first I had tried to learn the UI, but because it was so dense, and there was just so much, it became a challenge for me to keep myself engaged.  From the very rudimentry skills I got from reading the manual, I began to start building.  Everytime I hit a problem, I would look up on google to see if anyone else was having the same problems.</p>
