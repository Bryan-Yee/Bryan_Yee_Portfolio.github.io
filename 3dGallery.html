This was a personal project of mine.  It was to create a place where I could showcase my art, but I also wanted it to be more interesting, something to differientiate it from other people's galleries, so I decided to create my own art gallery in 3D. 
 The idea came after I had gone to many different art museums over the summer, that I, if I learned to, could create my own art gallery that I could use to showcase my art.  So I got to work, slowly learning Autodesk Maya.  At first I had tried to learn the UI, but because it was so dense, and there was just so much, it became a challenge for me to keep myself engaged.  From the very rudimentry skills I got from reading the manual, I began to start building.  Everytime I hit a problem, I would look up on google to see if anyone else was having the same problems.</p>

For Example, I had a large problem whenever I opened my saved project, my geometry was a jumbled mess.  Sometimes it fixed itself by quiting out and reloading, but it was still cause for concern.  After soome research I had found that you because the way maya works is that everytime you load your build maya tries to read the history of the object, and figure out how you got there.  To fix it you're supposed to delete the history of the object.

  Another problem I ran into, was trying to upload it onto the web.  In Unity you're able to build the project in "Webgl" and upload it onto a server/webpage.  I would keep building it, and uploading it, but it never worked.  With some help from my father who's an engineer, we found in the console commands of the web browser that it was due to the version of Unity we were using.  Apparently it was too new for the web browser.  After reverting back to a later version that it finally started to work.
