       <h1>3D Art Gallery</h1>
       <p> 
        This 3D art gallery was a personal project of mine, where I was able to create a place where I could showcase my art. I  wanted it to be more interesting, something to differientiate it from other people's galleries, so I decided to create my own art gallery in 3D. In creating this project I learned a a lot from this project, from learning how to 3D model, to import it into a website, to finding an effiencient learning method to learn all this new medium.</p>

<h2>Creating the 3D Models</h2>
          <p>
 The idea came after I visited a numerad of museums over the summer abroad in London. I wanted to create my own art gallery that I could use to showcase my art.  So I got to work, figuring out what I wanted to showcase, and decided that the, since I had recently created a lot of concept art for my D&D campaign, I decided to showcase that concept art.  Once I created a floor plan, I slowly but surely learned how to create a 3D enviorment in Autodesk Maya.  At first I had tried to learn the UI, but because it was so dense, and there was just so much, it became a challenge for me to keep myself engaged.  Instead, I decided to take the little skills I had aquired and worked case by case, looking up tutorials for each question and problem I faced.

       <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      
      <p>For example, I had a large problem whenever I opened my saved project, my geometry was a jumbled mess.  Sometimes it fixed itself by quiting out and reloading, but it was still cause for concern.  After soome research I had found that you because the way maya works is that everytime you load your build maya tries to read the history of the object, and figure out how you got there.  To fix it you're supposed to delete the history of the object. </p>
              <p>
           Another problem I ran into, was trying to upload it onto the web.  In Unity you're able to build the project in "Webgl" and upload it onto a server/webpage.  After a few days of searching I found that I had to revert to an older edition of Unity for it to work.  After reverting back to a later version that it finally started to work.

      <p>After Once the geometry was created, and a bit of trouble shooting, I began to test importing it to Unity to create a First Person Camera (FPC) that would allow you to walk around inside the museum.  After a few problems (and fixes) with the collision and uploading it to a website, I went back to Maya to set up the artwork and lighting.  </p>
