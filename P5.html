        <h1>p5.js : Interactive Media Projects</h1>

        <p>I worked with P5.js in my (CLASS) which was my first introduction into coding. At first, I struggled to think
          creatively with this new medium of art, One project I messed up so badly, that it broke entirely and I had no
          clue what I had did wrong and was unable to fix it in time to submit it. As I became more and more comfortable
          with coding, I started experimenting with what I could do, like using perlin noise (random number generator)
          to make an aesthetically pleasing waves. </p>

        <h2>Examples of my p5.js Projects</h2>
<p>These smaller projects were done right after learning about these technique with a one week deadline. Some are more complicated than others due to my knowledge of p5.js at the time. </p>

        <h2>Pokemon API project</h2>
        <p> For our final, we were tasked with implementing an API or data set into our project and were given a large
          selection of public access APIs to choose from. After looking through them all, I decided on trying to see
          what I could make with the Pokémon API as it has been a game that I’ve played since I was a kid. The hardest
          part of getting the Pokemon API to work was the images. Due to how p5.js is essentially 2 programing languages
          jammed into one, and bad timing with a large snowstorm, I was forced to learn how to code the images in,
          without the help of my professor. After a lot of trial, errors and staring at various tutorials, I was finally
          able to produce a picture. While I wasn’t satisfied with how the colors looked in the final product, I was
          really happy that I was able to display the images themselves.
