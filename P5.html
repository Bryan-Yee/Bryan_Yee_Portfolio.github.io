      <h2>p5.js</h2>

            <p>I worked with P5.js in my (CLASS) which was my first introduction into coding.  At first, I struggled to think creatively with this new medium of art, One project I messed up so badly, that it broke entirely and I had no clue what I had did wrong and was unable to fix it in time to submit it.  As I became more and more comfortable with coding, I started experimenting with what I could do, like using perlin noise (random number generator) to make an aesthetically pleasing waves.  </p>
<p> For our final, we were tasked with implementing an API or data set into our project and were given a large selection of public access APIs to choose from.  After looking through them all, I decided on trying to see what I could make with the Pokémon API as it has been a game that I’ve played since I was a kid.  The hardest part of getting the Pokemon API to work was the images.  Due to how p5.js is essentially 2 programing languages jammed into one, and bad timing with a large snowstorm, I was forced to learn how to code the images in, without the help of my professor.  After a lot of trial, errors and staring at various tutorials, I was finally able to produce a picture.  While I wasn’t satisfied with how the colors looked in the final product, I was really happy that I was able to display the images themselves.
