        <h2>The Joy of Character Creation</h2>

        <p>
          Dungeons & Dragons has become a recent passion of mine, only a few years old, but I was almost instantly
          hooked on creating various characters with unique characteristics, backstories and strange ways to play them.

        <h2>Losa Lillali </h2>
        <img src="Illustration104.png" style="width:500px;">
        <p>Losa Lillali(Right) is my most recent and is a Changeling bard.  This means they can change what they look like and are experts at impersonating people.  Right now they're masquerading as their lost duet partner, Holdrea Honvar(Left).</p>

        <h2>Dagron The Tall</h2>
        <img src="Illustration87.png" style="width:500px">
        <p>Dagron was my first character I ever played in Dungeons and Dragons and his design was fairly simple compared to my others. despite being human, he looks like a tall dwarf due to the dwarven society he grew up in. The antler on his head isn't a choice by design, but was an accidental mutation.</p>

        <h2>Fun Gai</h2>
        <img src="FUN GAI.png" style="width:500px;">
        <p>Fun Gai is one of my more recent characters, a circle of Spores, Tortle Druid. I wanted to make someone who was able to fight on the front lines as well as be helpful to the rest of the party. They're group oriented and will go with what the group wants as they're controlled by a collective of spores that live on their body.

        <h2>Iredia</h2>
        <img src="New Iredia.png" style="width:500px;">
        <p>This is my Aasimar Paladin, Iredia. She went through some iterations, but after a drawing her over and over
          again, I settled on a more muscular form as she was the muscle of the group.The scarring around her eyes were
          inspired from her ability to shoot light from her eyes, that not only damage her enemies, but herself as well.

        <h2>Zek Snev</h2>
        <img src="Kobold.png" style="width:500px;">
        <p>Zek is a Lore Kobold, College of Lore bard. I stumbled upon the interesting combination as I was trying to
          make a bard to support my friends. In a post apocalyptic desert, he combats his light sensitive eyes with
          sungoggles and jams with a keytar.</p>
