D&D has become a recent passion of mine, only a few years old, but I was almost instantly hooked when I got into it. </p>

<h1>What is D&D?</h1>
<p class= "padded">
D&D also known as Dungeons and Dragons, is a table top roleplaying game, where one person is the dungeon master.  They create the story for all of the other players to follow, or not follow.  I find it fasinating as there are times where things, don't always goes to the Dungeon Master's plan, and they must adapt to the player's choices.  For Example, creating a 40ft explosion in a crowded tavern, or turning the large demon into a snail, or ruining an entire desert town's economy because you can create and destroy water.
