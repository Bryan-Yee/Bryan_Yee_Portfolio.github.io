      The Joy of Character Creation
    </h1>
    <p>A group of friends were in the process of creating a turn-based RPG video game, similiar to a tabletop RPGs
      such as Dungeons and Dragons. I was asked to help with the artwork, mainly the backgrounds and enemy concept
      art. While there was a lot of talk and brainstorming, our development was put on hold due to exams as well as
      the current pandemic.
