       <h2>What is D&D?</h2>
      
      <p> 
D&D has become a recent passion of mine, only a few years old, but I was almost instantly hooked when I got into it. 

        D&D also known as Dungeons and Dragons, is a table top roleplaying game, where one person is the dungeon master.  They create the story for all of the other players to follow, or not follow.  I find it fasinating as there are times where things, don't always goes to the Dungeon Master's plan, and they must adapt to the player's choices.  For Example, creating a 40ft explosion in a crowded tavern, or turning the large demon into a snail, or ruining an entire desert town's economy because you can create and destroy water.

      <p>It took a while really understanding what I was able to accomplish with R, but after reading and getting help from my professor, I was able to figure it out.  R became a lot easier as soon as we moved onto the open window (FIND BETTE PHRASE FOR THIS) which is usually used for programming. </p>
